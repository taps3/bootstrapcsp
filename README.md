# bootstrapcsp
curriculum repository for bootstrap csp

My plan is to use this repository to collect and order the material that I have created over the years for bootstrap. I will download files from google drive and save them as microsoft office files. I will apply themes to those files to homogenize their look. I will then tag the files with the content they associate with. Finally I will edit the files to complete and remove any contextual data.
